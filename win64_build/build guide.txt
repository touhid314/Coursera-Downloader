pyinstaller --icon=icon.ico maingui.py

after build: 
change the file name, otherwise the icon doesn't come up
copy the icon.ico file to the dist folder, otherwise crashes.

make installer with installforge:
* use the saved file as template.
* change the folder location, most probably only having the dist folder is enough
* version
* shortcut location
* run as admin registry value.
